## :rocket: Cool tech

- Multiple Gems in use (PG, Puma, BCrypt, HTTParty)
- Postgresql

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Unique constraints handling
- Lack of remove from wishlist button

## :sob: Lessons learnt
What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...
- Take it slower
- Scale it down and then add features. 

## :white_check_mark: Future features
Cool things I would add if I can keep working on this
- Add a search function
- Add API connectivity
- Turn into the original rental of being a rental game store
